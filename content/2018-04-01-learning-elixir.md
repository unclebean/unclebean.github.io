#### Elixir in practice

  I used long weekend to write a tiny elixir project to parse log doing analytics job. I remembered that I wrote same using java, golang, python, js to do the same job. I have to say elixir is comfortably. I really enjoy to use elixir. 

  There are some features I really like from elixir
  
  1. case pattern match
  2. Enum functions e.g map, reduce, filter
  3. function pipeline.
  4. write unit test is easy.
  5. gen server & supervisor 
  6. marco
